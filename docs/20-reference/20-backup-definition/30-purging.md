# Purging
Purging is the process of deleting superfluous or outdated backups. By default, purging is disabled. You have to explicitly define a purge policy.

A purge policy is based upon two values:
1. the *retention age* 
2. and the *retention count*.

Both values can be configured in the [*backup definition*](overview#retention).
